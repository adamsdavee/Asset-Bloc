## Key Highlights:

### Decentralized Asset Trading

AssetFraction provides a decentralized platform where individuals can sell their assets by creating events with specific durations. The entire process is facilitated on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and security.

### Document Verification by Admins

To maintain the integrity of the platform, all submitted documents are thoroughly verified by designated administrators. This step ensures that only legitimate assets are listed, enhancing the overall trustworthiness of the AssetFraction ecosystem.

### Fractionalized Ownership

Buyers have the opportunity to purchase fractions of an asset, allowing for more accessible and diversified investment opportunities. NFTs representing these fractions are minted and transferred to the buyers on the blockchain.

### NFT Marketplace Integration

AssetFraction seamlessly integrates with NFT marketplaces, enabling buyers to resell their fractionalized assets. This feature adds liquidity to the market and provides a secondary trading option for NFT owners.

### Blockchain-Based Security

Leveraging blockchain technology ensures the security and immutability of ownership records, reducing the risk of fraud and unauthorized alterations.

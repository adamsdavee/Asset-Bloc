# AssetFraction: Fractionalized Asset Trading on the Blockchain

## Project Abstract

AssetFraction is a revolutionary Dapp that leverages blockchain technology to transform the traditional asset trading landscape. This decentralized platform allows users to sell their assets in fractions, opening up new possibilities for investment and ownership. With a focus on transparency, security, and accessibility, AssetFraction aims to redefine how individuals engage with and benefit from asset ownership.

## Project Breakdown

### Project Overview

AssetFraction is a decentralized asset trading platform that introduces fractionalized ownership through blockchain technology. The platform enables individuals to create events to sell their assets, with the process facilitated on the blockchain for enhanced security and transparency. The key objectives include:

1. **Decentralized Asset Trading:** Provide a secure and transparent platform for individuals to sell their assets in fractions.

2. **Document Verification by Admins:** Ensure the legitimacy of listed assets by having administrators verify the submitted documents.

3. **Fractionalized Ownership:** Allow buyers to purchase fractions of an asset, making asset ownership more accessible and diversified.

4. **NFT Marketplace Integration:** Seamlessly integrate with NFT marketplaces, enabling buyers to resell their fractionalized assets.

### Intended Impact and Benefits

- **Accessibility to Asset Ownership:** Enable individuals to invest in high-value assets by purchasing fractions, making previously unattainable assets accessible to a broader audience.

- **Trust and Legitimacy:** Implement document verification by administrators to maintain the integrity of the platform, instilling trust in both buyers and sellers.

- **Liquidity and Secondary Market:** Integration with NFT marketplaces provides liquidity to fractionalized assets, allowing buyers to resell their fractions on the secondary market.

### How it Works

1. **Wallet Connection:** Users securely connect their crypto wallets to the platform to facilitate transactions.

2. **Event Creation:** Sellers initiate an event, providing details about the asset, its type, and the duration of the sale. Admins verify submitted documents.

3. **Fractionalized Ownership:** Buyers purchase fractions of the asset, and corresponding NFTs are minted and transferred to their wallets.

4. **NFT Marketplace:** Buyers have the option to resell their fractionalized assets on NFT marketplaces, enhancing liquidity.

5. **Blockchain-Based Security:** Utilize blockchain technology to ensure the security and immutability of ownership records.

### Technology Stack

- **Blockchain Platform:** Ethereum

# Fractionalize: Achieving Ownership One Token at a Time

## Project Abstract

Fractionalize is a decentralized application (Dapp) that introduces a groundbreaking approach to property ownership through fractionalization, utilizing ERC-20 tokens and unique NFTs. This platform revolutionizes the real estate landscape by providing users with the opportunity to buy and sell fractions of various properties in a secure and transparent manner.

## Project Breakdown

### Project Overview

Fractionalize aims to democratize property ownership by allowing users to invest in real estate without the need for significant capital. Leveraging blockchain technology, the platform ensures transparent transactions, immutable ownership records, and streamlined trading of property fractions.

### Key Objectives

- **Accessible Real Estate Investment:** Enable individuals to invest in high-value properties with minimal capital.
- **Immutable Ownership Records:** Leverage blockchain to maintain transparent and tamper-proof ownership records.
- **Efficient Trading:** Facilitate seamless buying and selling of property fractions through ERC-20 tokens and NFTs.

### Intended Impact and Benefits

- **Financial Inclusion:** Open up real estate investment opportunities to a broader audience.
- **Liquidity:** Increase liquidity in the real estate market by allowing fractional ownership trading.
- **Security and Transparency:** Ensure secure and transparent transactions through blockchain technology.

### How it Works

1. **Property Tokenization:** Properties are tokenized into fractions represented by ERC-20 tokens.
2. **Unique NFTs for Each Fraction:** Each property fraction is associated with a unique NFT for ownership verification.
3. **Trading on the Platform:** Users can buy and sell property fractions using the ERC-20 tokens on the Fractionalize platform.
